There are many design patterns that have been identified in software engineering, but some of the most common ones include:

Creational patterns, which focus on how objects are created and instantiated. Examples of creational patterns include the Singleton, Factory Method, and Prototype patterns.

Structural patterns, which focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures. Examples of structural patterns include the Adapter, Bridge, and Composite patterns.

Behavioral patterns, which focus on how objects interact and operate within a larger system. Examples of behavioral patterns include the Observer, Strategy, and State patterns.

Concurrency patterns, which focus on the management of multiple threads or processes. Examples of concurrency patterns include the Monitor Object, Thread Pool, and Double-Checked Locking patterns.

Architectural patterns, which focus on the overall organization and structure of a software system. Examples of architectural patterns include the Model-View-Controller, Microservices, and Event-Driven architecture patterns.

Anti-pattern, which are common but problematic ways of doing things, they are the opposite of design patterns. Examples of anti-patterns include the God Object, Spaghetti code, and Golden Hammer.

It's worth noting that some patterns could overlap in multiple categories, for example, Singleton pattern is a Creational pattern but it also could be considered an architectural pattern.
Also, these are not the only design patterns, these are the most common and well-known ones.
